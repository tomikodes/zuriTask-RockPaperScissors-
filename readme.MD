This is a simple Rock Paper and Scissor game using python.
The task was given by the Zuri team.
I made use of local python random module by 
        import random

I also made use of the .choice() method which is a function of the random module

I made use of the if, elif and else conditional statement.
A while loop will be executed if the player should input the wrong choice
the loop will only break once the player input a valid choice.

Valid choices are:
"R" which stands for Rock
"P" which stands for Paper
"S" which stands for Scissors

I was unable to add a loop once the game comes to an end as it its outside the scope of this task.
In future update to this game, the team will consider that.
Hence, the player intend to continue the game once it ends, the player is to restart the game.
